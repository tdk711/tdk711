### Hey!

I'm someone who's passionate about computational engineering, especially for naval, offshore and coastal applications.

<br>

Currently, I'm an undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. I'm majoring in Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering and my minor is Computational Hydrodynamics.

My main driver is **C++**, but I'm also proficient in **FORTRAN**, **Python**, **JavaScript** and **MATLAB**.

My Interests include:
- Wave-Structure Interaction using RANS
- Non-Linear Potential Wave Simulation
- HPC Implementation of CFD Codes
- Finite Element Structural Analysis

Check out some of my projects below:
- [Wave Analysis Toolbox](https://github.com/tdk711/Wave-Analysis-Toolbox) - MATLAB GUI program to obtain spectral and time domain parameters from a sea surface elevation time series
- [3D Parallel Poisson Solver]() - Finite-Difference 3D Cartesian Poisson's Equation Solver parallelized using MPI
